# Welcome
After all these years of work I've decided to create a repository showing all of my work. The project is not finished but I'll continue to update until we have a clean and good version of the Ring Engine.

# Source Code
Here we have a lots of types of source code, begginer codes, intermediate codes and advanced codes. I did not write most of the code, most of it was by lurodsil I only rewrote scripts to make it function closer to Sonic Unleased

# Note
This was made before lurodsil released the new version of the Ring Engine a couple of weeks ago.
